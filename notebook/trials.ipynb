Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsigniﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional\\ncomputation [26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 16]. In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 11]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,x n) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1,...,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1,...,y m) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h= 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[31, 2, 8].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0,xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\n5'),\n",

One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[31] and byte-pair [25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\n6'),\n",

This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k<n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 15], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+ n·d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side beneﬁt, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [17] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate= d−0.5\\nmodel ·min(step_num−0.5,step_num·warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the ﬁrst warmup_stepstraining steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps= 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [27] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\n7'),\n",

Learning this model end-to-\\nend requires backpropagating through a retrieval step that\\nconsiders an entire corpus of textual knowledge, as shown\\nin Figure\\n1.\\nThe key intuition of REALM is to train the retriever us-\\ning a performance-based signal from unsupervised text:\\na retrieval that improves the language model’s perplex-\\nity is helpful and should be rewarded, while an un-\\ninformative retrieval should be penalized. For exam-\\nple, in Figure\\n1, if the model needs to ﬁll the blank\\nin “ the at the top of the pyramid”, the re-\\ntriever should be rewarded for selecting a document con-\\ntaining “ The pyramidion on top allows for less\\nmaterial higher up the pyramid”. W e achieve this\\nbehavior by modeling our retrieve-then-predict approach\\nas a latent variable language model and optimizing the\\nmarginal likelihood.\\nIncorporating a large-scale neural retrieval module durin g\\npre-training constitutes a signiﬁcant computational chal -\\nlenge, since the retriever must consider millions of candi-\\ndate documents for each pre-training step, and we must\\nbackpropagate through its decisions. T o address this, we\\nstructure the retriever such that the computation performe d\\nfor each document can be cached and asynchronously up-\\ndated, and selection of the best documents can be formu-\\nlated as Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS).\\nNumerous prior works have demonstrated the bene-\\nﬁt of adding a discrete retrieval step to neural net-\\nworks (\\nMiller et al. , 2016; Chen et al. , 2017), but did not\\napply the framework to language model pre-training and\\nemployed non-learned retrievers to handle large-scale doc -\\nument collections. In the language modeling literature, th e\\nk-Nearest Neighbor Language Model (\\nKhandelwal et al. ,\\n2019) ( kNN-LM) retrieves similar LM examples to im-\\nprove memorization. However, kNN-LM was not ﬁne-\\ntuned for downstream tasks, perhaps because it is unclear\\nhow to adapt the retrieval mechanism: a kNN can only use\\nexamples labeled for the target task—during ﬁne-tuning,\\nthis precludes LM examples, which contain the desired\\nworld knowledge. In contrast, REALM’s retriever is de-\\nsigned to transfer to other tasks, and the retrieval is just\\ntext, not a labeled example.\\nW e evaluate our approach by ﬁne-tuning the mod-\\nels pre-trained with REALM on the task of Open-\\ndomain Question Answering (Open-QA), one of the most\\nknowledge-intensive tasks in natural language process-\\ning. W e evaluate on three popular Open-QA bench-\\nmarks ( NAT U R A LQU E S T I O N S -O P EN , WE B QU E S T I O N S , and\\nCU R AT E DTR E C) and compare to state-of-the-art Open-QA\\nmodels, including both extremely large models that store\\nknowledge implicitly (such as T5) as well as previous ap-\\nproaches that also use a knowledge retriever to access ex-\\nternal knowledge, but implement retrieval in a more heuris-\\ntic fashion (\\nLee et al. , 2019; Min et al. , 2019a; Asai et al. ,\\n2019). REALM achieves new state-of-the-art results on all\\nthree benchmarks, signiﬁcantly outperforming all previou s\\nsystems by 4-16% absolute accuracy. W e also demonstrate\\nqualitative beneﬁts of REALM, including interpretability\\nand modularity.\\n2. Background\\nLanguage model pre-training The goal of language\\nmodel pre-training is to learn useful representations of la n-\\nguage, usually from unlabeled text corpora. The resulting\\npre-trained model can then be further trained ( ﬁne-tuned )\\nfor a downstream task of primary interest (in our case,\\nOpen-QA), often leading to better generalization than trai n-\\ning from scratch (\\nDai & Le , 2015; Radford et al. , 2019).\\nW e focus on the masked language model 2 (MLM) variant\\nof pre-training popularized by BER T ( Devlin et al. , 2018).\\nIn its basic form, an MLM is trained to predict the miss-\\ning tokens in an input text passage. Given an unlabeled\\npre-training corpus X (e.g., Wikipedia text), a training ex-\\nample (x, y ) can be generated by randomly masking to-\\nkens in a sampled piece of text (e.g., x = “ The [MASK]\\nis the currency [MASK] the UK”; y = (“ pound”,\\n“ of”)). The model uses its representation of the masked\\ninput x to predict the token that should go in each mask.\\nA good MLM must learn to encode syntactic and semantic\\ninformation (e.g., to predict “ of”) as well as some world\\nknowledge (e.g., to predict “ pound”).\\nOpen-domain question answering (Open-QA) T o mea-\\nsure a model’s ability to incorporate world knowledge, we\\nneed a downstream task where world knowledge is criti-\\ncal. Perhaps one of the most knowledge-intensive tasks in\\nnatural language processing is open-domain question an-\\nswering (Open-QA): given a question x such as “ What is\\nthe currency of the UK?”, a model must output the\\ncorrect answer string y, “ pound”. The “open” part of Open-\\nQA refers to the fact that the model does not receive a pre-\\nidentiﬁed document that is known to contain the answer,\\nunlike traditional reading comprehension (RC) tasks such\\nas SQuAD (\\nRajpurkar et al. , 2016; 2018). While RC mod-\\n1 W e use the term “document” loosely to refer to a passage\\nfrom the knowledge corpus, not necessarily a whole article.\\n2 Strictly speaking, MLM is not a standard language model,\\nsince it does not deﬁne a distribution over the entire sequen ce\\nof tokens. In the paper we sometimes abuse the term “language\\nmodel” slightly to make the phrase shorter.'),\n",

Many of these\\nsystems employ a retrieval-based approach: given a ques-\\ntion x, retrieve potentially relevant documents z from\\nthe corpus Z, and then extract an answer y from the\\ndocuments (\\nBrill et al. , 2002; Chen et al. , 2017; Lee et al. ,\\n2019). Our approach, REALM, is inspired by this\\nparadigm and extends it to language model pre-training.\\nAlternatively, some recent work has proposed generation-\\nbased systems that apply a sequence-to-sequence model on\\nx to directly generate y token-by-token ( Lewis et al. , 2019;\\nRaffel et al. , 2019). W e will compare against state-of-the-\\nart systems from both paradigms in our experiments.\\n3. Approach\\nW e start by formalizing REALM’s pre-training and ﬁne-\\ntuning tasks as a retrieve-then-predict generative process\\nin Section\\n3.1. Then in Section 3.2, we describe the model\\narchitectures for each component of that process. In Sec-\\ntion\\n3.3, we show how to implement REALM pre-training\\nand ﬁne-tuning by maximizing the likelihood of REALM’s\\ngenerative process. En route, we address important compu-\\ntational challenges, explain why training works, and also\\ndiscuss strategies for injecting useful inductive biases. The\\noverall framework is illustrated in Figure\\n2.\\n3.1. REALM’s generative process\\nFor both pre-training and ﬁne-tuning, REALM takes some\\ninput x and learns a distribution p(y | x) over possible out-\\nputs y. For pre-training, the task is masked language mod-\\neling: x is a sentence from a pre-training corpus X with\\nsome tokens masked out, and the model must predict the\\nvalue of those missing tokens, y. For ﬁne-tuning, the task\\nis Open-QA: x is a question, and y is the answer.\\nREALM decomposes p(y | x) into two steps: retrieve, then\\npredict. Given an input x, we ﬁrst retrieve possibly helpful\\ndocuments z from a knowledge corpus Z. W e model this as\\na sample from the distribution p(z | x). Then, we condition\\non both the retrieved z and the original input x to generate\\nthe output y—modeled as p(y | z, x ). T o obtain the overall\\nlikelihood of generating y, we treat z as a latent variable\\nand marginalize over all possible documents z, yielding\\np(y | x) =\\n∑\\nz∈Z\\np(y | z, x ) p(z | x). (1)\\n3.2. Model architecture\\nW e now describe the two key components: the\\nneural knowledge retriever , which models p(z | x),\\nand the knowledge-augmented encoder , which models\\np(y | z, x ).\\nKnowledge Retriever The retriever is deﬁned using a\\ndense inner product model:\\np(z | x) = exp f(x, z )\\n∑\\nz′ exp f(x, z ′),\\nf(x, z ) =Embedinput(x)⊤Embeddoc(z),\\nwhere Embedinput and Embeddoc are embedding functions\\nthat map x and z respectively to d-dimensional vectors.\\nThe relevance score f(x, z ) between x and z is deﬁned as\\nthe inner product of the vector embeddings. The retrieval\\ndistribution is the softmax over all relevance scores.\\nW e implement the embedding functions using BER T -style\\nTransformers (\\nDevlin et al. , 2018). Following standard\\npractices, we join spans of text by applying wordpiece tok-\\nenization, separating them with [SEP] tokens, preﬁxing a\\n[CLS] token, and appending a ﬁnal [SEP] token.\\njoinBERT(x) =[CLS]x[SEP]\\njoinBERT(x1, x 2) =[CLS]x1[SEP]x2[SEP]\\nAs in\\nDevlin et al. (2018), we pass this into a Transformer,\\nwhich produces one vector for each token, including the\\nvector corresponding to [CLS] which is used as a “pooled”\\nrepresentation of the sequence (denoted BERTCLS). Finally,\\nwe perform a linear projection to reduce the dimensionality\\nof the vector, denoted as a projection matrix W:\\nEmbedinput(x) =WinputBERTCLS(joinBERT(x))\\nEmbeddoc(z) =WdocBERTCLS(joinBERT(ztitle , z body))\\nwhere ztitle is the document’s title and zbody is its body. W e\\nlet θ denote all parameters associated with the retriever,\\nwhich include the Transformer and projection matrices.\\nKnowledge-Augmented Encoder Given an input x and\\na retrieved document z, the knowledge-augmented encoder\\ndeﬁnes p(y | z, x ). W e join x and z into a single sequence\\nthat we feed into a Transformer (distinct from the one used\\nin the retriever). This allows us to perform rich cross-\\nattention between x and z before predicting y. See Figure\\n1\\nfor a concrete example.\\nAt this stage, the architectures for pre-training and ﬁne-\\ntuning differ slightly. For the masked language model pre-\\ntraining task, we must predict the original value of each\\n[MASK] token in x. T o do so, we use the same masked'),\n",

T raining\\nFor both pre-training and ﬁne-tuning, we train by maxi-\\nmizing the log-likelihood log p(y | x) of the correct out-\\nput y. Since both the knowledge retriever and knowledge-\\naugmented encoder are differentiable neural networks, we\\ncan compute the gradient of log p(y | x) (deﬁned in Equa-\\ntion\\n1) with respect to the model parameters θ and φ, and\\noptimize using stochastic gradient descent.\\nThe key computational challenge is that the marginal prob-\\nability p(y | x) =∑\\nz∈Z p(y | x, z ) p(z | x) involves a sum-\\nmation over all documents z in the knowledge corpus Z.\\nW e approximate this by instead summing over the top k\\ndocuments with highest probability under p(z | x)—this is\\nreasonable if most documents have near zero probability.\\nEven with this approximation, we still need an efﬁcient way\\nto ﬁnd the top k documents. Note that the ordering of doc-\\numents under p(z | x) is the same as under the relevance\\nscore f(x, z ) = Embedinput(x)⊤Embeddoc(z), which is an\\ninner product. Thus, we can employ Maximum Inner Prod-\\nuct Search (MIPS) algorithms to ﬁnd the approximate top k\\ndocuments, using running time and storage space that scale\\nsub-linearly with the number of documents (\\nRam & Gray ,\\n2012; Shrivastava & Li , 2014; Shen et al. , 2015).\\nT o employ MIPS, we must pre-compute Embeddoc(z) for\\nevery z ∈ Z and construct an efﬁcient search index over\\nthese embeddings. However, this data structure will no\\nlonger be consistent with p(z | x) if the parameters θ of\\nEmbeddoc are later updated. Hence, the search index goes\\n“stale” after every gradient update on θ.\\nOur solution is to “refresh” the index by asynchronously\\nre-embedding and re-indexing all documents every several\\nhundred training steps. The MIPS index is slightly stale be-\\ntween refreshes, but note that it is only used to select the\\ntop k documents. W e recompute p(z | x) and its gradient,\\nusing the fresh θ, for these top k documents after retriev-\\ning them.

For ﬁne-tuning, we just build the MIPS in-\\ndex once (using the pre-trained θ) for simplicity and do not\\nupdate Embeddoc.\\n3 Note that we still ﬁne-tune Embedinput,\\nso the retrieval function is still updated from the query sid e.\\nWhat does the retriever learn? Since the knowledge re-\\ntrieval of REALM is latent, it is not obvious how the train-\\ning objective encourages meaningful retrievals. Here, we\\nshow how it rewards retrievals that improve prediction ac-\\ncuracy.\\nFor a given query x and document z, recall that f(x, z ) is\\nthe “relevance score” that the knowledge retriever assigns\\nto document z. W e can see how a single step of gradient\\ndescent during REALM pre-training alters this score by an-\\nalyzing the gradient with respect to the parameters of the\\nknowledge retriever, θ:\\n∇ log p(y | x) =\\n∑\\nz∈Z\\nr(z)∇f(x, z )\\nr(z) =\\n[ p(y | z, x )\\np(y | x) − 1\\n]\\np(z | x).\\nFor each document z, the gradient encourages the retriever\\nto change the score f(x, z ) by r(z) — increasing if r(z)\\nis positive, and decreasing if negative. The multiplier r(z)\\nis positive if and only if p(y | z, x ) > p (y | x). The term\\np(y | z, x ) is the probability of predicting the correct output\\ny when using document z. The term p(y | x) is the expected\\nvalue of p(y | x, z ) when randomly sampling a document\\nfrom p(z | x). Hence, document z receives a positive up-\\ndate whenever it performs better than expected.\\n3 This works because pre-training already yields a good\\nEmbeddoc function. However, it is possible that refreshing the in-\\ndex would further improve performance.\\n3.4. Injecting inductive biases into pre-training\\nIn the process of developing REALM, we discovered sev-\\neral additional strategies that further guide the model to-\\nwards meaningful retrievals, described below .\\nSalient span masking During REALM pre-training, we\\nwant to focus on examples x that require world knowledge\\nto predict the masked tokens. As explained in Section\\n2,\\nsome MLM spans only require local context. T o focus on\\nproblems that require world knowledge, we mask salient\\nspans such as “ United Kingdom” or “ July 1969”. W e\\nuse a BER T -based tagger trained on CoNLL-2003 data\\n(\\nSang & De Meulder , 2003) to identify named entities, and\\na regular expression to identify dates. W e select and mask\\none of these salient spans within a sentence for the masked\\nlanguage modeling task. W e show that this signiﬁcantly\\noutperforms other masking strategies in Section\\n4.5.\\nNull document Even with salient span masking, not all\\nmasked tokens require world knowledge to predict. W e\\nmodel this by adding an empty null document ∅ to the top\\nk retrieved documents, allowing appropriate credit to be as-\\nsigned to a consistent sink when no retrieval is necessary.\\nProhibiting trivial retrievals If the pre-training corpus\\nX and the knowledge corpus Z are the same, there exists\\na trivial retrieval candidate z that is too informative: if the\\nmasked sentence x comes from document z, the knowledge\\naugmented encoder can trivially predict y by looking at the\\nunmasked version of x in z. This results in a large positive\\ngradient for p(z | x). If this occurs too often, the knowledge\\nretriever ends up learning to look for exact string matches\\nbetween x and z, which does not capture other forms of\\nrelevance. For this reason, we exclude this trivial candida te\\nduring pre-training.\\nInitialization At the beginning of training, if the retriever\\ndoes not have good embeddings for Embedinput(x) and\\nEmbeddoc(z), the retrieved documents z will likely be unre-\\nlated to x. This causes the knowledge augmented encoder\\nto learn to ignore the retrieved documents. Once this oc-\\ncurs, the knowledge retriever does not receive a meaning-\\nful gradient and cannot improve, creating a vicious cycle.\\nT o avoid this cold-start problem, we warm-start Embedinput\\nand Embeddoc using a simple training objective known as\\nthe Inverse Cloze T ask (ICT) where, given a sentence, the\\nmodel is trained to retrieve the document where that sen-\\ntence came from.

(2017).\\nCuratedT rec The CuratedTrec dataset is a collection of\\nquestion-answer pairs drawn from real user queries issued\\non sites such as MSNSearch and AskJeeves. T o account for\\nmultiple correct answers or different spelling variations , the\\nanswers in this dataset are deﬁned as regular expressions\\nthat match all correct answers. It is unclear how to train\\ngeneration-based models with this type of supervision, so\\nwe do not evaluate them on this dataset.\\n4.2. Approaches compared\\nRetrieval-based Open-QA Most existing Open-QA sys-\\ntems answer the input question by ﬁrst retrieving poten-\\ntially relevant documents from a knowledge corpus, and\\nthen using a reading comprehension system to extract an\\nanswer from the documents. In this paradigm, the knowl-\\nedge is stored explicitly in the corpus. W e wish to compare\\ndifferent methods for implementing retrieval.\\nMany approaches use non-learned heuristic retrieval such\\nas sparse bag-of-words matching (\\nRobertson et al. , 2009)\\nor entity linking on the question to select a small set of rel-\\nevant documents (e.g., 20). These documents are typically\\nthen re-ranked using a learned model, but coverage may be\\nlimited by the initial heuristic retrieval step. Approache s\\nsuch as DrQA (\\nChen et al. , 2017), HardEM ( Min et al. ,\\n2019a), GraphRetriever ( Min et al. , 2019b), and PathRe-\\ntriever ( Asai et al. , 2019) in T able 1 are in this category.\\nSome recent approaches have proposed to implement learn-\\nable retrieval using a MIPS index. ORQA (\\nLee et al. , 2019)\\nformulates Open-QA using a similar latent variable model\\nas REALM, and also trains by maximizing the marginal\\nlikelihood. However, REALM adds a novel language\\nmodel pre-training step, and backpropagates into the MIPS\\nindex, rather than using a ﬁxed index. In T able\\n1, we di-\\nrectly compare the two. It is also important to note that\\nthe retrievers for both REALM pretraining and ORQA are\\ninitialized using the Inverse Cloze T ask, described in Sec-\\ntion\\n3.4.\\nGeneration-based Open-QA An emerging alternative\\napproach to Open-QA is to model it as a sequence pre-\\ndiction task: simply encode the question, and then decode\\nthe answer token-by-token based on the encoding. While\\nit was initially unclear how large amounts of knowledge\\ncould be injected into the model, GPT -2 (\\nRadford et al. ,\\n2019) hinted at the possibility of directly generating an-\\nswers without using any given context via sequence-to-\\nsequence. However, their performance was not competi-\\ntive possibly due to the lack of ﬁne-tuning. Orthogonally,\\nT5 (\\nRaffel et al. , 2019) showed that directly generating an-\\nswers without explicit extraction from the given context is\\nviable approach, but they only experimented on the read-\\ning comprehension task, where a context document is pro-\\nvided.\\nFor the most competitive and comparable generation-based\\nbaseline, we compare to concurrent work which ﬁne-tunes\\nT5 for Open-QA (\\nRoberts et al. , 2020).4 W e compare\\nagainst the Base, Large, and even larger 11-billion parame-\\nter model to measure the effect of model size.\\n4.3. Implementation Details\\nFine-tuning W e reuse all hyperparameters from\\nLee et al. (2019), to enable direct comparison. Our\\nknowledge corpus is derived from the December 20, 2018\\nsnapshot of English Wikipedia. Documents are greedily\\nsplit into chunks of up to 288 BER T wordpieces, resulting\\nin just over 13 million retrieval candidates. During ﬁne-\\ntuning inference, we consider the top-5 candidates, and the\\n4 W e initially conducted our own T5 experiments using\\nthe code from https://tinyurl.com/t5-openqa-colab (Raffel et al. ,\\n2019). W e now report results from the concurrent work of\\nRoberts et al. (2020), which has an improved ﬁne-tuning proce-\\ndure.'),\n",

T able\\n1 also shows the\\nnumber of parameters for each model.\\nAs reported in the concurrent work of Roberts et al. (2020),\\nthe generative Open-QA systems based on T5 are surpris-\\ningly powerful, with the largest T5-11B model outperform-\\ning the previous best Open-QA system. Increasing the size\\nof T5 yields consistent improvement, but comes at signif-\\nicant computational cost (from Base to 11B, the model is\\n50 times larger, and gains roughly 5 points in accuracy). In\\ncontrast, REALM outperforms the largest T5-11B model\\nwhile being 30 times smaller. It is also important to note\\nthat T5 accesses additional reading comprehension data\\nfrom SQuAD during its pre-training (100,000+ examples).\\nAccess to such data could also beneﬁt REALM, but was not\\nused in our experiments.\\nAmong all systems, the most direct comparison with\\nREALM is ORQA (\\nLee et al. , 2019), where the ﬁne-tuning\\nsetup, hyperparameters and training data are identical. Th e\\nimprovement of REALM over ORQA is purely due to bet-\\nter pre-training methods. The results also indicate that ou r\\nmethod of pre-training can be applied both on (1) the single-\\ncorpus setting ( X = Wikipedia, Z = Wikipedia), or (2) the\\nseparate-corpus setting ( X = CC-News, Z = Wikipedia).\\nCompared to other retrieval-based systems (\\nAsai et al. ,\\n2019; Min et al. , 2019a;b) which often retrieve from 20 to\\n80 documents, our system gets the overall best performance\\nwhile only retrieving 5 documents.\\n4.5.

In addition\\nto the end-to-end results, we also report how often the gold\\nanswer appears in the top-5 retrievals before applying any\\nﬁne-tuning.

An example where REALM utilizes retrieved documents to bett er predict masked tokens. It assigns much higher probabilit y\\n(0.129) to the correct term, “ Fermat”, compared to BERT . (Note that the blank corresponds to 3 BER T wordpieces.)\\nx: An equilateral triangle is easily constructed using a stra ightedge and compass, because 3 is a prime.\\n(a) BERT p(y = “ Fermat” |x) = 1 . 1 × 10− 14 (No retrieval.)\\n(b) REALM p(y = “ Fermat” |x, z ) = 1. 0 (Conditional probability with document z =“257 is . . . a Fermat prime.\\nThus a regular polygon with 257 sides is constructible with c ompass . . . ”)\\n(c) REALM p(y = “ Fermat” |x) = 0 . 129 (Marginal probability , marginalizing over top 8 retrieved documents.)\\nEncoder or Retriever W e ﬁrst aim to determine whether\\nREALM pre-training improves the retriever or the encoder,\\nor both. T o do so, we can reset the parameters of either\\nthe retriever or the encoder to their baseline state before\\nREALM pre-training, and feed that into ﬁne-tuning. Reset-\\nting both the retriever and encoder reduces the system to\\nour main baseline, ORQA. W e ﬁnd that both the encoder\\nand retriever beneﬁt from REALM training separately, but\\nthe best result requires both components acting in unison.\\nMasking scheme W e compare our salient span masking\\nscheme (Section\\n3.4) with (1) random token masking in-\\ntroduced in BER T ( Devlin et al. , 2018) and (2) random\\nspan masking proposed by SpanBER T ( Joshi et al. , 2019).\\nWhile such salient span masking has not been shown to\\nbe impactful in previous work with standard BER T train-\\ning (\\nJoshi et al. , 2019), it is crucial for REALM. Intuitively,\\nthe latent variable learning relies heavily on the utility o f re-\\ntrieval and is therefore more sensitive to a consistent lear n-\\ning signal.\\nMIPS index refresh rate During pre-training, we run a\\nparallel process to re-embed corpus documents and rebuild\\nthe MIPS index. This results in one index refresh per ap-\\nproximately 500 training steps. T o demonstrate the impor-\\ntance of frequent index refreshes, we compare against using\\na slower refresh rate. The results in T able\\n2 suggests that\\na stale index can hurt model training, and further reducing\\nthis staleness could offer better optimization.\\nExamples of retrieved documents T able\\n3 shows an\\nexample of the REALM masked language model predic-\\ntion. In this example, “ Fermat” is the correct word, and\\nREALM (row (c)) gives the word a much high probability\\ncompared to the BER T model (row (a)). Since REALM\\nmanages to retrieve some documents with a related fact\\n(row (b)), the marginalized probability of the correct an-\\nswer dramatically increases. This shows that REALM is\\nable to retrieve document to ﬁll in the masked word even\\nthough it is trained with unsupervised text only.\\n5. Discussion and Related W ork\\nW e previously discussed related methods for Open-QA.\\nHere we present several alternate ways of viewing REALM\\nthat connect it to a broader set of ideas beyond Open-QA:\\nLanguage modeling with corpus as context Language\\nrepresentation models have been incorporating contexts of\\nincreasingly large scope when making predictions. Ex-\\namples of this progression include models that condi-\\ntion on surrounding words (\\nMikolov et al. , 2013a;b), sen-\\ntences ( Kiros et al. , 2015; Peters et al. , 2018), and para-\\ngraphs ( Radford et al. , 2018; Devlin et al. , 2018). W e can\\nview REALM as a generalization of the above work to the\\nnext level of scope: the entire text corpus.\\nRetrieve-and-edit with learned retrieval In order to\\nbetter explain the variance in the input text and en-\\nable controllable generation,\\nGuu et al. (2018) proposed\\na language model with the retrieve-and-edit frame-\\nwork ( Hashimoto et al. , 2018) that conditions on text with\\nhigh lexical overlap. REALM has a similar approach, ex-\\ncept that the model learns for itself which texts are most\\nuseful for reducing perplexity. By jointly learning the re-\\ntriever, REALM has the capacity to depend on information\\nbeyond lexical overlap.\\nScalable grounded neural memory The document in-\\ndex can be viewed as a memory where the keys are\\nthe document embeddings. From this view , our work\\nshare motivations with works such as product key mem-\\nory (\\nLample et al. , 2019), which enables sub-linear mem-\\nory access in a memory network ( W eston et al. , 2014;\\nGraves et al. , 2014; Sukhbaatar et al. , 2015), allowing\\nthese scalable memory layers to be integrated into large\\nlanguage models. One main difference is that our memo-\\nries are grounded—each memory is associated with a docu-\\nment rather than unnamed value vectors. This level of inter-\\npretability is crucial for applications like Open-QA, wher e\\nusers would require provenance for a predicted answer to\\nbe trustworthy.\\nUnsupervised Corpus Alignment In sequence-to-\\nsequence models with attention (\\nBahdanau et al. , 2014),'),\n",

Derivation of the gradient with respect to\\nthe knowledge retriever\\nW e compute the gradient of the REALM pre-training objec-\\ntive (a log-likelihood) with respect to the parameters of th e\\nknowledge retriever, θ:\\n∇ log p(y | x) =p(y | x)−1∇p(y | x)\\n= p(y | x)−1 ∑\\nz\\np(y | z, x )∇p(z | x)\\n= p(y | x)−1 ∑\\nz\\np(y | z, x )p(z | x)∇ log p(z | x)\\n=\\n∑\\nz\\np(z | y, x )∇ log p(z | x),\\nwhere the last line follows from applying conditional\\nBayes’ rule.

Connection between REALM and\\nsupervised learning\\nFrom the equations in Appendix A, we saw that\\n∇ log p (y | x) =\\n∑\\nz\\n[p (z | y, x ) − p (z | x)] ∇f(x, z ).\\nSuppose that there exists one document z∗ which causes\\nthe model to achieve perfect prediction accuracy (i.e.,\\np (y | z∗, x ) = 1), while all other documents z′ result in\\nzero accuracy (i.e., p (y | z′, x ) = 0 ). Under this set-\\nting, p (z∗ | y, x ) = 1(provided that p (z∗ | x) is non-zero),\\nwhich causes the gradient to become\\n∇ log p (y | x) =∇f (x, z ∗) −\\n∑\\nz\\np (z | x) ∇f(x, z )\\n= ∇ log p (z∗ | x) .\\nFrom this, we see that gradient descent on the REALM ob-\\njective is equivalent to gradient descent on log p (z∗ | x).\\nThis is none other than the typical maximum likelihood\\ntraining objective used in supervised learning, where z∗ is\\nthe “gold” document.\\nC. Adapting to new knowledge\\nAn explicit retrieval system allows us to adapt to new\\nworld knowledge simply by modifying the corpus docu-\\nments. T o demonstrate this ability, we replace the knowl-\\nedge corpus with a more recent version of Wikipedia cor-\\npus after pre-training is done. When the input query is\\nabout a fact where the two corpora disagree, REALM can\\nchange the prediction to reﬂect the updated information,\\nas exempliﬁed in T able\\n4. However, even with an ex-\\nplicit retrieval mechanism, the knowledge-augmented en-\\ncoder will still end up remembering some world knowl-\\nedge, making the prediction of some input sentences not\\nupdated with the new corpus. (For instance, the model pre-\\ndicts “ Thatcher” for “\\nis the prime minister\\nof United Kingdom.” on both corpora, perhaps due to\\nthe frequent mention of her name in Wikipedia articles.)\\nD. Retrieval Utility\\nThe null document ∅ described in Section\\n3.4 provides a\\nway to measure the importance of a retrieved document z:\\nwe deﬁne the retrieval utility (RU) of z for the masked\\ninput x as the difference between the log-likelihood of\\nthe knowledge-augmented encoder when conditioning on\\nz versus on ∅ :\\nRU(z | x) = logp(y | z, x ) − log p(y | ∅ , x ). (2)\\nA negative RU shows that z is less useful for predicting y\\nthan the null document. This could mean that z is irrelevant\\nto x, but could also mean that the masked tokens in x do\\nnot require world knowledge to predict, or that the world\\nknowledge is sufﬁciently commonplace it has been baked\\ninto the model’s parameters. In practice, we ﬁnd that RU\\nincreases steadily over the course of pre-training, and is\\nmore predictive of good performance on the downstream\\ntask of Open-QA than even the overall log-likelihood. An\\nexample of how RU behaves over time and across different\\nsettings is in Figure\\n4.'),\n",

However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowl-\\nedge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance\\nlags behind task-speciﬁc architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their\\ndecisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-\\ntrained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric\\nmemory have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We\\nexplore a general-purpose ﬁne-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation\\n(RAG) — models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric mem-\\nory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric\\nmemory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense\\nvector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We com-\\npare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages\\nacross the whole generated sequence, and another which can use different passages\\nper token. We ﬁne-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-\\nintensive NLP tasks and set the state of the art on three open domain QA tasks,\\noutperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-speciﬁc retrieve-and-extract\\narchitectures.

They can do so without any access to an external memory, as a parameterized\\nimplicit knowledge base [51, 52]. While this development is exciting, such models do have down-\\nsides: They cannot easily expand or revise their memory, can’t straightforwardly provide insight into\\ntheir predictions, and may produce “hallucinations” [38]. Hybrid models that combine parametric\\nmemory with non-parametric (i.e., retrieval-based) memories [20, 26, 48] can address some of these\\nissues because knowledge can be directly revised and expanded, and accessed knowledge can be\\ninspected and interpreted. REALM [ 20] and ORQA [ 31], two recently introduced models that\\ncombine masked language models [8] with a differentiable retriever, have shown promising results,\\narXiv:2005.11401v4  [cs.CL]  12 Apr 2021'),\n",

Here, we bring hybrid parametric\\nand non-parametric memory to the “workhorse of NLP,” i.e. sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models.\\nWe endow pre-trained, parametric-memory generation models with a non-parametric memory through\\na general-purpose ﬁne-tuning approach which we refer to as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\\nWe build RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq transformer, and the\\nnon-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural\\nretriever. We combine these components in a probabilistic model trained end-to-end (Fig. 1). The\\nretriever (Dense Passage Retriever [26], henceforth DPR) provides latent documents conditioned on\\nthe input, and the seq2seq model (BART [32]) then conditions on these latent documents together with\\nthe input to generate the output. We marginalize the latent documents with a top-K approximation,\\neither on a per-output basis (assuming the same document is responsible for all tokens) or a per-token\\nbasis (where different documents are responsible for different tokens). Like T5 [51] or BART, RAG\\ncan be ﬁne-tuned on any seq2seq task, whereby both the generator and retriever are jointly learned.\\nThere has been extensive previous work proposing architectures to enrich systems with non-parametric\\nmemory which are trained from scratch for speciﬁc tasks, e.g. memory networks [ 64, 55], stack-\\naugmented networks [25] and memory layers [ 30]. In contrast, we explore a setting where both\\nparametric and non-parametric memory components are pre-trained and pre-loaded with extensive\\nknowledge. Crucially, by using pre-trained access mechanisms, the ability to access knowledge is\\npresent without additional training.\\nOur results highlight the beneﬁts of combining parametric and non-parametric memory with genera-\\ntion for knowledge-intensive tasks—tasks that humans could not reasonably be expected to perform\\nwithout access to an external knowledge source. Our RAG models achieve state-of-the-art results\\non open Natural Questions [29], WebQuestions [3] and CuratedTrec [2] and strongly outperform\\nrecent approaches that use specialised pre-training objectives on TriviaQA [24]. Despite these being\\nextractive tasks, we ﬁnd that unconstrained generation outperforms previous extractive approaches.\\nFor knowledge-intensive generation, we experiment with MS-MARCO [1] and Jeopardy question\\ngeneration, and we ﬁnd that our models generate responses that are more factual, speciﬁc, and\\ndiverse than a BART baseline. For FEVER [56] fact veriﬁcation, we achieve results within 4.3% of\\nstate-of-the-art pipeline models which use strong retrieval supervision. Finally, we demonstrate that\\nthe non-parametric memory can be replaced to update the models’ knowledge as the world changes.1\\n2 Methods\\nWe explore RAG models, which use the input sequencexto retrieve text documents zand use them\\nas additional context when generating the target sequence y.

In one approach, RAG-Sequence, the model uses the same document\\nto predict each target token. The second approach, RAG-Token, can predict each target token based\\non a different document. In the following, we formally introduce both models and then describe the\\npη and pθ components, as well as the training and decoding procedure.\\n2.1 Models\\nRAG-Sequence Model The RAG-Sequence model uses the same retrieved document to generate\\nthe complete sequence. Technically, it treats the retrieved document as a single latent variable that\\nis marginalized to get the seq2seq probability p(y|x) via a top-K approximation. Concretely, the\\ntop K documents are retrieved using the retriever, and the generator produces the output sequence\\nprobability for each document, which are then marginalized,\\npRAG-Sequence(y|x) ≈\\n∑\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x))\\npη(z|x)pθ(y|x,z) =\\n∑\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x))\\npη(z|x)\\nN∏\\ni\\npθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1)\\nRAG-Token Model In the RAG-Token model we can draw a different latent document for each\\ntarget token and marginalize accordingly. This allows the generator to choose content from several\\ndocuments when producing an answer. Concretely, the top K documents are retrieved using the\\nretriever, and then the generator produces a distribution for the next output token for each document,\\nbefore marginalizing, and repeating the process with the following output token, Formally, we deﬁne:\\npRAG-Token(y|x) ≈\\nN∏\\ni\\n∑\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x))\\npη(z|x)pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1)\\nFinally, we note that RAG can be used for sequence classiﬁcation tasks by considering the target class\\nas a target sequence of length one, in which case RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token are equivalent.\\n2.2 Retriever: DPR\\nThe retrieval component pη(z|x) is based on DPR [26]. DPR follows a bi-encoder architecture:\\npη(z|x) ∝exp\\n(\\nd(z)⊤q(x)\\n)\\nd(z) =BERTd(z), q(x) =BERTq(x)\\nwhere d(z) is a dense representation of a document produced by a BERTBASE document encoder [8],\\nand q(x) a query representation produced by a query encoder, also based on BERTBASE. Calculating\\ntop-k(pη(·|x)), the list of kdocuments zwith highest prior probability pη(z|x), is a Maximum Inner\\nProduct Search (MIPS) problem, which can be approximately solved in sub-linear time [23]. We use\\na pre-trained bi-encoder from DPR to initialize our retriever and to build the document index. This\\nretriever was trained to retrieve documents which contain answers to TriviaQA [24] questions and\\nNatural Questions [29]. We refer to the document index as the non-parametric memory.\\n2.3 Generator: BART\\nThe generator component pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1) could be modelled using any encoder-decoder. We use\\nBART-large [32], a pre-trained seq2seq transformer [58] with 400M parameters. To combine the input\\nxwith the retrieved content zwhen generating from BART, we simply concatenate them. BART was\\npre-trained using a denoising objective and a variety of different noising functions. It has obtained\\nstate-of-the-art results on a diverse set of generation tasks and outperforms comparably-sized T5\\nmodels [32].

Instead, we run beam search for\\neach document z, scoring each hypothesis using pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1). This yields a set of hypotheses\\nY, some of which may not have appeared in the beams of all documents. To estimate the probability\\nof an hypothesis y we run an additional forward pass for each document z for which y does not\\nappear in the beam, multiply generator probability with pη(z|x) and then sum the probabilities across\\nbeams for the marginals. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Thorough Decoding.” For longer\\noutput sequences, |Y|can become large, requiring many forward passes. For more efﬁcient decoding,\\nwe can make a further approximation that pθ(y|x,zi) ≈0 where ywas not generated during beam\\nsearch from x,zi. This avoids the need to run additional forward passes once the candidate set Y has\\nbeen generated. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Fast Decoding.”\\n3 Experiments\\nWe experiment with RAG in a wide range of knowledge-intensive tasks. For all experiments, we use\\na single Wikipedia dump for our non-parametric knowledge source. Following Lee et al. [31] and\\nKarpukhin et al. [26], we use the December 2018 dump. Each Wikipedia article is split into disjoint\\n100-word chunks, to make a total of 21M documents. We use the document encoder to compute an\\nembedding for each document, and build a single MIPS index using FAISS [23] with a Hierarchical\\nNavigable Small World approximation for fast retrieval [37]. During training, we retrieve the top\\nkdocuments for each query. We consider k∈{5,10}for training and set kfor test time using dev\\ndata. We now discuss experimental details for each task.\\n3.1 Open-domain Question Answering\\nOpen-domain question answering (QA) is an important real-world application and common testbed\\nfor knowledge-intensive tasks [20]. We treat questions and answers as input-output text pairs (x,y)\\nand train RAG by directly minimizing the negative log-likelihood of answers. We compare RAG to\\nthe popular extractive QA paradigm [5, 7, 31, 26], where answers are extracted spans from retrieved\\ndocuments, relying primarily on non-parametric knowledge. We also compare to “Closed-Book\\nQA” approaches [52], which, like RAG, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead\\nrelying purely on parametric knowledge. We consider four popular open-domain QA datasets: Natural\\nQuestions (NQ) [29], TriviaQA (TQA) [24]. WebQuestions (WQ) [3] and CuratedTrec (CT) [2]. As\\nCT and WQ are small, we follow DPR [26] by initializing CT and WQ models with our NQ RAG\\nmodel. We use the same train/dev/test splits as prior work [ 31, 26] and report Exact Match (EM)\\nscores. For TQA, to compare with T5 [52], we also evaluate on the TQA Wiki test set.\\n3.2 Abstractive Question Answering\\nRAG models can go beyond simple extractive QA and answer questions with free-form, abstractive\\ntext generation. To test RAG’s natural language generation (NLG) in a knowledge-intensive setting,\\nwe use the MSMARCO NLG task v2.1 [ 43]. The task consists of questions, ten gold passages\\nretrieved from a search engine for each question, and a full sentence answer annotated from the\\nretrieved passages.

As\\nthis is a new task, we train a BART model for comparison. Following [67], we evaluate using the\\nSQuAD-tuned Q-BLEU-1 metric [ 42]. Q-BLEU is a variant of BLEU with a higher weight for\\nmatching entities and has higher correlation with human judgment for question generation than\\nstandard metrics. We also perform two human evaluations, one to assess generation factuality, and\\none for speciﬁcity. We deﬁne factuality as whether a statement can be corroborated by trusted external\\nsources, and speciﬁcity as high mutual dependence between the input and output [ 33]. We follow\\nbest practice and use pairwise comparative evaluation [34]. Evaluators are shown an answer and two\\ngenerated questions, one from BART and one from RAG. They are then asked to pick one of four\\noptions—quuestion A is better, question B is better, both are good, or neither is good.\\n3.4 Fact Veriﬁcation\\nFEVER [ 56] requires classifying whether a natural language claim is supported or refuted by\\nWikipedia, or whether there is not enough information to decide. The task requires retrieving\\nevidence from Wikipedia relating to the claim and then reasoning over this evidence to classify\\nwhether the claim is true, false, or unveriﬁable from Wikipedia alone. FEVER is a retrieval problem\\ncoupled with an challenging entailment reasoning task. It also provides an appropriate testbed for\\nexploring the RAG models’ ability to handle classiﬁcation rather than generation. We map FEVER\\nclass labels (supports, refutes, or not enough info) to single output tokens and directly train with\\nclaim-class pairs. Crucially, unlike most other approaches to FEVER, we do not use supervision on\\nretrieved evidence. In many real-world applications, retrieval supervision signals aren’t available, and\\nmodels that do not require such supervision will be applicable to a wider range of tasks. We explore\\ntwo variants: the standard 3-way classiﬁcation task (supports/refutes/not enough info) and the 2-way\\n(supports/refutes) task studied in Thorne and Vlachos [57]. In both cases we report label accuracy.\\n4 Results\\n4.1 Open-domain Question Answering\\nTable 1 shows results for RAG along with state-of-the-art models. On all four open-domain QA\\ntasks, RAG sets a new state of the art (only on the T5-comparable split for TQA). RAG combines\\nthe generation ﬂexibility of the “closed-book” (parametric only) approaches and the performance of\\n\"open-book\" retrieval-based approaches. Unlike REALM and T5+SSM, RAG enjoys strong results\\nwithout expensive, specialized “salient span masking” pre-training [20]. It is worth noting that RAG’s\\nretriever is initialized using DPR’s retriever, which uses retrieval supervision on Natural Questions\\nand TriviaQA. RAG compares favourably to the DPR QA system, which uses a BERT-based “cross-\\nencoder” to re-rank documents, along with an extractive reader. RAG demonstrates that neither a\\nre-ranker nor extractive reader is necessary for state-of-the-art performance.\\nThere are several advantages to generating answers even when it is possible to extract them. Docu-\\nments with clues about the answer but do not contain the answer verbatim can still contribute towards\\na correct answer being generated, which is not possible with standard extractive approaches, leading\\n5'),\n",

RAG approaches state-of-the-art model performance, which is\\nimpressive given that (i) those models access gold passages with speciﬁc information required to\\ngenerate the reference answer , (ii) many questions are unanswerable without the gold passages, and\\n(iii) not all questions are answerable from Wikipedia alone. Table 3 shows some generated answers\\nfrom our models. Qualitatively, we ﬁnd that RAG models hallucinate less and generate factually\\ncorrect text more often than BART. Later, we also show that RAG generations are more diverse than\\nBART generations (see §4.5).\\n4.3 Jeopardy Question Generation\\nTable 2 shows that RAG-Token performs better than RAG-Sequence on Jeopardy question generation,\\nwith both models outperforming BART on Q-BLEU-1. 4 shows human evaluation results, over 452\\npairs of generations from BART and RAG-Token. Evaluators indicated that BART was more factual\\nthan RAG in only 7.1% of cases, while RAG was more factual in 42.7% of cases, and both RAG and\\nBART were factual in a further 17% of cases, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of RAG on\\nthe task over a state-of-the-art generation model. Evaluators also ﬁnd RAG generations to be more\\nspeciﬁc by a large margin. Table 3 shows typical generations from each model.\\nJeopardy questions often contain two separate pieces of information, and RAG-Token may perform\\nbest because it can generate responses that combine content from several documents. Figure 2 shows\\nan example. When generating “Sun”, the posterior is high for document 2 which mentions “The\\nSun Also Rises”. Similarly, document 1 dominates the posterior when “A Farewell to Arms” is\\ngenerated. Intriguingly, after the ﬁrst token of each book is generated, the document posterior ﬂattens.\\nThis observation suggests that the generator can complete the titles without depending on speciﬁc\\ndocuments. In other words, the model’s parametric knowledge is sufﬁcient to complete the titles. We\\nﬁnd evidence for this hypothesis by feeding the BART-only baseline with the partial decoding\"The\\nSun. BART completes the generation \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"The Sun\\nAlso Rises\" indicating the title \"The Sun Also Rises\" is stored in BART’s parameters. Similarly,\\nBART will complete the partial decoding \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"A\\nwith \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"A Farewell to Arms\". This example shows\\nhow parametric and non-parametric memories work together—the non-parametric component helps\\nto guide the generation, drawing out speciﬁc knowledge stored in the parametric memory.\\n4.4 Fact Veriﬁcation\\nTable 2 shows our results on FEVER. For 3-way classiﬁcation, RAG scores are within 4.3% of\\nstate-of-the-art models, which are complex pipeline systems with domain-speciﬁc architectures and\\nsubstantial engineering, trained using intermediate retrieval supervision, which RAG does not require.\\n6'),\n",

We calculate the overlap in article titles between the topkdocuments retrieved\\nby RAG and gold evidence annotations. We ﬁnd that the top retrieved document is from a gold article\\nin 71% of cases, and a gold article is present in the top 10 retrieved articles in 90% of cases.\\n4.5 Additional Results\\nGeneration Diversity Section 4.3 shows that RAG models are more factual and speciﬁc than\\nBART for Jeopardy question generation. Following recent work on diversity-promoting decoding\\n[33, 59, 39], we also investigate generation diversity by calculating the ratio of distinct ngrams to\\ntotal ngrams generated by different models. Table 5 shows that RAG-Sequence’s generations are\\nmore diverse than RAG-Token’s, and both are signiﬁcantly more diverse than BART without needing\\nany diversity-promoting decoding.\\nRetrieval Ablations A key feature of RAG is learning to retrieve relevant information for the task.\\nTo assess the effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism, we run ablations where we freeze the retriever\\nduring training. As shown in Table 6, learned retrieval improves results for all tasks.\\nWe compare RAG’s dense retriever to a word overlap-based BM25 retriever [53]. Here, we replace\\nRAG’s retriever with a ﬁxed BM25 system, and use BM25 retrieval scores as logits when calculating\\np(z|x). Table 6 shows the results. For FEVER, BM25 performs best, perhaps since FEVER claims are\\nheavily entity-centric and thus well-suited for word overlap-based retrieval. Differentiable retrieval\\nimproves results on all other tasks, especially for Open-Domain QA, where it is crucial.\\nIndex hot-swapping An advantage of non-parametric memory models like RAG is that knowledge\\ncan be easily updated at test time. Parametric-only models like T5 or BART need further training to\\nupdate their behavior as the world changes. To demonstrate, we build an index using the DrQA [5]\\nWikipedia dump from December 2016 and compare outputs from RAG using this index to the newer\\nindex from our main results (December 2018). We prepare a list of 82 world leaders who had changed\\n7'),\n",

A single, pre-trained language model\\nhas been shown to achieve strong performance on various classiﬁcation tasks in the GLUE bench-\\nmarks [60, 61] after ﬁne-tuning [49, 8]. GPT-2 [50] later showed that a single, left-to-right, pre-trained\\nlanguage model could achieve strong performance across both discriminative and generative tasks.\\nFor further improvement, BART [32] and T5 [51, 52] propose a single, pre-trained encoder-decoder\\nmodel that leverages bi-directional attention to achieve stronger performance on discriminative\\nand generative tasks. Our work aims to expand the space of possible tasks with a single, uniﬁed\\narchitecture, by learning a retrieval module to augment pre-trained, generative language models.\\nLearned Retrieval There is signiﬁcant work on learning to retrieve documents in information\\nretrieval, more recently with pre-trained, neural language models [ 44, 26] similar to ours. Some\\nwork optimizes the retrieval module to aid in a speciﬁc, downstream task such as question answering,\\nusing search [46], reinforcement learning [6, 63, 62], or a latent variable approach [31, 20] as in our\\nwork. These successes leverage different retrieval-based architectures and optimization techniques to\\nachieve strong performance on a single task, while we show that a single retrieval-based architecture\\ncan be ﬁne-tuned for strong performance on a variety of tasks.\\nMemory-based Architectures Our document index can be seen as a large external memory for\\nneural networks to attend to, analogous to memory networks [64, 55]. Concurrent work [14] learns\\nto retrieve a trained embedding for each entity in the input, rather than to retrieve raw text as in our\\nwork. Other work improves the ability of dialog models to generate factual text by attending over\\nfact embeddings [15, 13]. A key feature of our memory is that it is comprised of raw text rather\\ndistributed representations, which makes the memory both (i) human-readable, lending a form of\\ninterpretability to our model, and (ii) human-writable, enabling us to dynamically update the model’s\\nmemory by editing the document index. This approach has also been used in knowledge-intensive\\ndialog, where generators have been conditioned on retrieved text directly, albeit obtained via TF-IDF\\nrather than end-to-end learnt retrieval [9].\\nRetrieve-and-Edit approaches Our method shares some similarities with retrieve-and-edit style\\napproaches, where a similar training input-output pair is retrieved for a given input, and then edited\\nto provide a ﬁnal output. These approaches have proved successful in a number of domains including\\nMachine Translation [ 18, 22] and Semantic Parsing [21]. Our approach does have several differences,\\nincluding less of emphasis on lightly editing a retrieved item, but on aggregating content from several\\npieces of retrieved content, as well as learning latent retrieval, and retrieving evidence documents\\nrather than related training pairs. This said, RAG techniques may work well in these settings, and\\ncould represent promising future work.\\n6 Discussion\\nIn this work, we presented hybrid generation models with access to parametric and non-parametric\\nmemory. We showed that our RAG models obtain state of the art results on open-domain QA. We\\nfound that people prefer RAG’s generation over purely parametric BART, ﬁnding RAG more factual\\nand speciﬁc. We conducted an thorough investigation of the learned retrieval component, validating\\nits effectiveness, and we illustrated how the retrieval index can be hot-swapped to update the model\\nwithout requiring any retraining. In future work, it may be fruitful to investigate if the two components\\ncan be jointly pre-trained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to BART or some\\nanother objective. Our work opens up new research directions on how parametric and non-parametric\\nmemories interact and how to most effectively combine them, showing promise in being applied to a\\nwide variety of NLP tasks.\\n9'),\n",

We ﬁnd that doing Maximum Inner Product Search\\nwith FAISS is sufﬁciently fast on CPU, so we store document index vectors on CPU, requiring∼100\\nGB of CPU memory for all of Wikipedia. After submission, We have ported our code to HuggingFace\\nTransformers [66]3, which achieves equivalent performance to the previous version but is a cleaner\\nand easier to use implementation. This version is also open-sourced. We also compress the document\\nindex using FAISS’s compression tools, reducing the CPU memory requirement to 36GB.

These\\nanswer annotations are exploited by extractive models during training as typically all the answer\\nannotations are used to ﬁnd matches within documents when preparing training data. For RAG, we\\nalso make use of multiple annotation examples for Natural Questions and WebQuestions by training\\nthe model with each (q,a) pair separately, leading to a small increase in accuracy. For TriviaQA,\\nthere are often many valid answers to a given question, some of which are not suitable training targets,\\nsuch as emoji or spelling variants. For TriviaQA, we ﬁlter out answer candidates if they do not occur\\nin top 1000 documents for the query.\\nCuratedTrec preprocessing The answers for CuratedTrec are given in the form of regular expres-\\nsions, which has been suggested as a reason why it is unsuitable for answer-generation models [20].\\nTo overcome this, we use a pre-processing step where we ﬁrst retrieve the top 1000 documents for\\neach query, and use the answer that most frequently matches the regex pattern as the supervision\\ntarget. If no matches are found, we resort to a simple heuristic: generate all possible permutations for\\neach regex, replacing non-deterministic symbols in the regex nested tree structure with a whitespace.\\nTriviaQA Evaluation setups The open-domain QA community customarily uses public develop-\\nment datasets as test datasets, as test data for QA datasets is often restricted and dedicated to reading\\ncompehension purposes. We report our results using the datasets splits used in DPR [26], which are\\nconsistent with common practice in Open-domain QA. For TriviaQA, this test dataset is the public\\nTriviaQA Web Development split. Roberts et al.[52] used the TriviaQA ofﬁcial Wikipedia test set\\ninstead. Févry et al. [14] follow this convention in order to compare with Roberts et al. [52] (See\\nappendix of [14]). We report results on both test sets to enable fair comparison to both approaches.\\nWe ﬁnd that our performance is much higher using the ofﬁcial Wiki test set, rather than the more\\nconventional open-domain test set, which we attribute to the ofﬁcial Wiki test set questions being\\nsimpler to answer from Wikipedia.\\nE Further Details on FEVER\\nFor FEVER classiﬁcation, we follow the practice from [ 32], and ﬁrst re-generate the claim, and\\nthen classify using the representation of the ﬁnal hidden state, before ﬁnally marginalizing across\\ndocuments to obtain the class probabilities. The FEVER task traditionally has two sub-tasks. The\\nﬁrst is to classify the claim as either \"Supported\", \"Refuted\" or \"Not Enough Info\", which is the task\\nwe explore in the main paper. FEVER’s other sub-task involves extracting sentences from Wikipedia\\nas evidence supporting the classiﬁcation prediction. As FEVER uses a different Wikipedia dump to\\nus, directly tackling this task is not straightforward. We hope to address this in future work.\\nF Null Document Probabilities\\nWe experimented with adding \"Null document\" mechanism to RAG, similar to REALM [20] in order\\nto model cases where no useful information could be retrieved for a given input. Here, ifkdocuments\\nwere retrieved, we would additionally \"retrieve\" an empty document and predict a logit for the null\\ndocument, before marginalizing over k+ 1predictions. We explored modelling this null document\\nlogit by learning (i) a document embedding for the null document, (ii) a static learnt bias term, or\\n(iii) a neural network to predict the logit. We did not ﬁnd that these improved performance, so in\\nthe interests of simplicity, we omit them. For Open MS-MARCO, where useful retrieved documents\\ncannot always be retrieved, we observe that the model learns to always retrieve a particular set of\\ndocuments for questions that are less likely to beneﬁt from retrieval, suggesting that null document\\nmechanisms may not be necessary for RAG.\\nG Parameters\\nOur RAG models contain the trainable parameters for the BERT-base query and document encoder of\\nDPR, with 110M parameters each (although we do not train the document encoder ourselves) and\\n406M trainable parameters from BART-large, 406M parameters, making a total of 626M trainable\\n18'),\n",

Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 15], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+ n·d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.'),\n",

We showed that our RAG models obtain state of the art results on open-domain QA. We\\nfound that people prefer RAG’s generation over purely parametric BART, ﬁnding RAG more factual\\nand speciﬁc. We conducted an thorough investigation of the learned retrieval component, validating\\nits effectiveness, and we illustrated how the retrieval index can be hot-swapped to update the model\\nwithout requiring any retraining. In future work, it may be fruitful to investigate if the two components\\ncan be jointly pre-trained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to BART or some\\nanother objective. Our work opens up new research directions on how parametric and non-parametric\\nmemories interact and how to most effectively combine them, showing promise in being applied to a\\nwide variety of NLP tasks.\\n9'),\n",

RAG could be\\nemployed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct beneﬁt to society, for example by endowing it\\nwith a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\\neffective at their jobs.\\nWith these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge\\nsource, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias. Since RAG can be\\nemployed as a language model, similar concerns as for GPT-2 [50] are valid here, although arguably\\nto a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in'),\n",

These weights represent the importance or relevance of each input element to the task. By applying the attention mechanism, the model can selectively focus on the most relevant information, improving its performance and efficiency.\n",
